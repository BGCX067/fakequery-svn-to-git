<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.3.1.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="fakequery.js"></script>
}}}

== Using jQuery Plugins with FakeQuery ==

FakeQuery will automatically support any plugins you include in the page provided that they are included _before_ the fake query script.
