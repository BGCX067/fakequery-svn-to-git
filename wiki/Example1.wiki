#summary Example of how fakeQuery works

= fakeQuery Example =

== jQuery code ==

The following jQuery code has been taken from the [http://jquery.com jQuery homepage].

{{{
function doSomething(){
   $("p.neat").addClass("ohmy").show("slow");
}
}}}

== The different ways to test this ==

The tests in this example are written in JsUnit format, you can easily adapt for different frameworks.

{{{

// start with a fresh fakeQuery
$$.reset();

// call the code to be tested
doSomething();

// stop recording calls now
$$.stopRecording();

// assert that show("slow") was called on the "p.neat" elements
assertTrue( $$.wasCalledOn("p.neat", "show", "slow") );

// Explicitly assert that calls were made:
assertTrue( $$.wasCalled($("p.neat")) );
assertTrue( $$.wasCalled($("p.neat").addClass("ohmy")) );
assertTrue( $$.wasCalled($("p.neat").addClass("ohmy").show("slow")) );

// Find the addClass call and make sure the first argument was "ohmy"
assertEquals( "ohmy", $$.lastCallTo.addClass.argument );

// Make sure that addClass was only called once
assertEquals(1, $$.getCallCount("addClass"));

// Make sure the show method was called once
assertEquals(1, $$.getCallCount("show"));

// Make sure the hide method was not called
assertEquals(0, $$.getCallCount("hide"));
