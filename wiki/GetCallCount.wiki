#summary Description of getCallCount method

= {{{getCallCount}}} =

getCallCount gets the number of times a call was made to the specified function name.

== Usage ==

{{{
(Number) $$.getCallCount( (String) functionName )
}}}

== {{{$$.getCallCount}}} vs {{{$$.callsTo.function.length}}} ==

Another way to access the number of times a function was called is to directly access the array for that function inside {{{$$.callsTo}}}.  But if a function is never called, the the array will never get created so you will end up trying to access the {{{length}}} property of an undefined object.

{{{$$.getCallCount}}} wraps this up for you and if no object exists, safely returns {{{0}}}.
